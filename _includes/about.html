          <p class="about-text"><strong>I enjoy tackling challenges centered around creating highly performant, scalable products</strong> I'm currently a full stack engineer working on healthcare enterprise applications that manage large amounts of data. I have experience developing and designing a wide range of solutions including web and enterprise applications and ETL pipelines. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently but also improves people's lives. </p>
          <p class="about-text">I love learning and applying new technologies to find better ways to solve problems with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something helpful with people that bring out the best in me.</p>

          <p class="about-text"><strong>I'm a recent graduate from the University of Chicago where I received a Master's in Computer Science.</strong> I have experience developing and designing a wide range of applications including standalone apps, web apps and enterprise applications. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently but also improves people's lives. </p>
          <p class="about-text">I love learning and applying new technologies to find better ways to solve problems with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something helpful with people that bring out the best in me.</p>
          <p class="about-text"><strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen,</strong> I'm probably traveling, looking for something new to eat/drink or learning a new song on my guitar.</p>
